"Mr Introvert"

She said she likes it when I'm social.But I would much rather refrain.She likes to call me Mr Introvert.I say I only save my words for her.Sometimes, I call her little crazy.She says she just knows how to smile.And when we dance, she's got the rudest two-step.Let your heart be free.Let your heart complete me.It's something I believe.Ooh, ooh.Baby, when it's just the two of us, oh I.I'm just trying to say.It's better off this way.Oh, baby, when it's just the two of us, oh I.I'm just trying to stay.Forever in this day.Oh

"Autonomy (Slave)"

Need laws of my own.No foreign guidance to direct me.This place is my home.Built here to protect me.So tell me why, I'm running back to your authority.You move my mind, from the weakest part of me.I don't need nothing more.Than the time of day.With the freedom to fall.And falling straight.I don't wanna be a slave.I don't wanna be a slave.A slave to what we've done.I don't wanna be a slave.To save.No, I don't wanna be a slave.No matter what we've been told.Gotta keep moving on.We'll keep making the moat.Til the boundary's gone.So tell me why our voices cannot be heard.And who decides just what we've left to learn.I don't need nothing more.Than the time of day.With the freedom to fall.And falling straight.I don't wanna be a slave.I don't wanna be a slave.A slave to what we've done.I don't wanna be a slave.To save.No, I don't wanna be a slave.And who are we to say that this is a way to go.And every freedom makes a choice to take control.And who are we to say that this is a way to go.When every freedom makes a choice to take control.I don't wanna be a slave, no no.I don't wanna be a slave.A slave to what we've done.I don't wanna be a slave.To save.No, I don't wanna be a slave

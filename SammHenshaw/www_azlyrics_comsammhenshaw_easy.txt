"Easy"

I'm a broken man.Yes I am.But I won't let it stand in my way.See these walls may fall.Plans may change.But I hope this ain't where I remain.It's only for a little while longer.I'm tryna stay strong but.It's hard when, you're shattered in two.Things could be easy.Sing easy.If I hadn't gone at this alone.That would be easy, easy.Sing easier for my soul.I'm a broken man.I've got flaws.I admit the mistakes I have made.And at times I feel, like I lost faith.But I hope this ain't where I remain.It's only for a little while longer.I'm tryna stay strong but.It's hard when, you're shattered in two.Things could be easy.Sing easy.If I hadn't gone at this alone.That would be easy, sing easy.Easier for my soul.I won't walk into the dark side of the morning.I'm afraid of all the things I may never see.And sometimes I swear it gets real hard.Or maybe it's just getting hard on me.Things could be easy.Sing easy.If I hadn't gone at this alone.That would be easy, sing easy.Sing easier for my soul.Sing easy, sing easy.If I hadn't gone at this alone.That would be easy, easy.Sing easier, easier.No, no, no, no.Could be easier.A little easier for my soul.Yeah, yeah.Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.Oh....Easier for my soul.Easier for my soul

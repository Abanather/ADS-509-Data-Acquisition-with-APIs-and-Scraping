"Night Calls"

We slept.Under the safety of darkness.We lived moments that I'll never know.Cause I'll find silver lining.Where stars are alive and they glow.But when time is divided.You see the things light doesn't show.I've been dreaming.Reality isn't what seems to be.Keep forgetting everything I though I knew.When the night calls.Oh, I keep dreaming.Yes, I've been dreaming.Fading.Consciously, consciously waiting.For daylight.To come and reclaim all our souls.Cause I'll find silver lining.Where stars are alive and they glow.But when time is divided.You see the things light doesn't show.I've been dreaming.Reality isn't what seems to be.Keep forgetting everything I though I knew.When the night calls.Oh, I keep dreaming.Yes, I've been dreaming.I've been dreaming.Reality isn't what seems to be.Keep forgetting everything I though I knew.When the night calls.Oh, I keep dreaming.Yes, I've been dreaming.Oh, I keep dreaming.Yes, I've been dreaming

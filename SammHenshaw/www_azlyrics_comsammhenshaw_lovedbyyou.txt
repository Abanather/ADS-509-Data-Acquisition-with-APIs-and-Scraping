"Loved By You"

I remember this thing that she used to do.She, she would, she would always hold my face.And look me dead in the eye.She'd say, "Do you love me?.How much?".I'll stop the storm, dry out the rain.I'll be the pill you take to ease all your pain.I'll be your pedal, drive you away.Be your sanity, when you feel insane.On your darkest days.I'll be your sun.The thing that you need the most.When you're left with none.Whatever you need, I will be.All I ask is to be loved by you.Oh, whatever you need, I will be.All I ask is to be loved by you.This gon' take time.But I'm willing to try.I'll be your therapy.To hold back the tide.I'll be your Uber driver.When it's getting late.I'll be your pressure babe.When it's too much to take.Whatever you need I will be.All I ask is to be loved by you, oh.Whatever it is you may need I will be.I gotta be loved by you.Oh, oh, oh, oh.Oh, oh, oh, oh.All I need babe.All I need babe.Oh, oh, oh.Oh, oh, oh

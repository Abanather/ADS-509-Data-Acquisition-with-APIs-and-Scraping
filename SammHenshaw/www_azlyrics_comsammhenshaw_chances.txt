"Chances"

I know you know.About the thrill when you play with fire.Do you feel safe.When you're standing still.Don't count on hope.Gotta take what you want survival.We still ain't here.But I know we will.There's no way around it.Don't try to escape the fall.Pick up the pieces that you thought you lost.So take what you want.We're nothing without these chances.You live and you learn.You learn and you lose.Cause there is no wrong.When we all have second chances.You live and you learn.You learn and you lose.So who's to know.Where I'll be if I leave tomorrow.I could be close.Or an age to go.Sometimes I feel.Like there's no way to fight it.So I take the risk.Just to know it's real.There's no way around it.Don't try to escape the fall.Pick up the pieces that you thought you lost.So take what you want.We're nothing without these chances.You live and you learn.You learn and you lose.Cause there is no wrong.When we all have second chances.You live and you learn.You learn and you lose.There's no way around it.Don't try to escape the fall.Pick up the pieces that you thought you lost.So take what you want.We're nothing without these chances.You live and you learn.You learn and you lose.Cause there is no wrong.When we all have second chances.You live and you learn.You learn and you lose

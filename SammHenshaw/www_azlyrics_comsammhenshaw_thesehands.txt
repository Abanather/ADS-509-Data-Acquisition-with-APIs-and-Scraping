"These Hands"

I've been procrastinating for far too long.I don't know where I'm heading but I'll move further, just move further.I'm so used to rejection but I don't mind.Said, I'll be alright, said, I'll be just fine.I'm working on my masterpiece.And I'm making it with these hands.This fate is not my destiny.So I'm shaping it with these hands.Oh, well, I'm giving and giving my all.Oh, well, I give 'til I can't give no more.I'm working on my masterpiece.And I'm making it with these hands.There's beauty in progression and no hope in fear.You can't keep me in the same position, I refuse, refuse to stay here.Not always learned my lesson but I don't mind.Said, I'll be alright, said, I'll be just fine.I'm working on my masterpiece.And I'm making it with these hands.This fate is not my destiny.So I'm shaping it with these hands.Oh, well, I'm giving and giving my all.Oh, well, I give 'til I can't give no more.I'm working on my masterpiece.And I'm making it with these hands.These hands are only made of flesh and bone.And those hands, not ready to give up on home.And I hope wherever I may need to go.I won't give it up, I won't give up, no.So I'm shaping it with these hands.Oh, well, I'm giving and giving my all.Oh, well, I give 'til I can't give no more.I'm working on my masterpiece.And I'm making it with these hands.Said I'm working on my masterpiece.And I'm making it with these hands.Working on my, oh my, with these hands
